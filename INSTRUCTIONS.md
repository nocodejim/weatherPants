## 1. Project Overview

WeatherPants is a simple Android application that fetches the current temperature for a predefined location (Lebanon, OH) using the OpenWeatherMap API and advises the user whether they should wear pants based on a temperature threshold (currently < 60Â°F).

## 2. Prerequisites

* **Git:** For version control. Install on Ubuntu: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install git`
* **Bash:** Standard on WSL/Ubuntu.
* **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Required by Android SDK/Gradle. Version 17 is recommended. (Installed automatically if using Docker). Install on Ubuntu: `sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk`
* **Docker (Optional but Recommended):** For using the containerized build environment. [Install Docker on Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/). Ensure the Docker daemon is running.
* **OpenWeatherMap API Key:** A free API key is required to fetch weather data.
    * Go to [https://openweathermap.org/appid](https://openweathermap.org/appid)
    * Sign up for a free account.
    * Generate an API key. It might take a few minutes to become active.
* **Android Device or Chromebook (Optional):** For running the app.
